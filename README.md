# automatic_grader
Repository to store files for EECE 2140's, Student Automatic Grader Project.

Contains classes to allow the user, the "Professor", to provide a folder directory and a classroom,
and return a set of grades representing how many correct outputs the students returned from their respective scripts.

These outputs are run from a file called "expected_outputs.txt" that provides sets of methods with input output pairs.
